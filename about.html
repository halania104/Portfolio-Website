          The moonlight fades from flower and tree,
          And the stars dim one by one;
          The tale is told, the song is sung,
          And the Fairy feast is done.
          The night-wind rocks the sleeping flowers,
          And sings to them, soft and low.
          The early birds erelong will wake:
          'T is time for the Elves to go.
      <br />
      <br />
          O'er the sleeping earth we silently pass,
          Unseen by mortal eye,
          And send sweet dreams, as we lightly float
          Through the quiet moonlit sky;--
          For the stars' soft eyes alone may see,
          And the flowers alone may know,
          The feasts we hold, the tales we tell:
          So 't is time for the Elves to go.
      </p>
      <p>
          From bird, and blossom, and bee,
          We learn the lessons they teach;
          And seek, by kindly deeds, to win
          A loving friend in each.
          And though unseen on earth we dwell,
          Sweet voices whisper low,
          And gentle hearts most joyously greet
          The Elves where'er they go.
          <br />
          <br />
          When next we meet in the Fairy dell,
          May the silver moon's soft light
          Shine then on faces gay as now,
          And Elfin hearts as light.
          Now spread each wing, for the eastern sky
          With sunlight soon will glow.
          The morning star shall light us home:
          Farewell! for the Elves must go.
